# Project Overview

This project leverages advanced machine-learning techniques to predict future weather conditions based on historical data. The model uses a dataset with several weather data points in a particular location. This flexible project allows us to execute it in any region, country, or continent. I proceeded to clean the data and make it usable for our analyses. 
Then, I run our script to make a series of well-informed predictions that include several factors to enhance their precision. This project is a work-in-progress. I will improve the methodology and analyses as I expand my knowledge of environmental sciences, data sciences, and the most recent tech breakthroughs. 

## Setup Used

- Python (3.8+ preferred)
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- JupyterLab
- Dataset from NOAA
